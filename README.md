# Kalcie-Calculator
One of my older projects where I made a simple calculator app with a flamboyant yet simple UI.  This was a 1 week long project built during my first year at SVKM's UPG College. Project goals included brushing up my UI skills and getting a good grasp over Building complex apps.  As this was a simple app I didn't face any difficulty but this app exists in my GitHub solely because I consider it to be one of a major milestones for my Software Development journey!
